# Spanish cards game

Intention of the game is to represent how players (threads) interact with a deck of cards.

For a player to win it needs to get all the cards in a succesive order from the same suit. 
But a player can only start collecting cards if they got the first card of a suit (number 1)

Once a player gets all 12 cards of a suit, in order, they become the winner. The game continues until all players have finished.
